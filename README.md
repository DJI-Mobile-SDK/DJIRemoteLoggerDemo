# DJI Remote Logger Tutorial

<!-- toc -->

This tutorial is designed for you to obtain a better understanding of the DJI Remote Logger Tool. It will teach you how to use it for showing application log messages on a simple webpage.

  You can download the entire sample project for this tutorial from the current **Github Page**.

## Introduction

  In order to use the DJI Remote Logger Tool, you should have two parts: **DJI iOS Mobile SDK** and **Server Script**. The remote logger feature is integrated inside the SDK, you can use this feature in your application directly. For the server part, there are two connection modes showing below:

### HTTP Mode

You can connect your iOS device and Mac to the same WiFi network or connect to a local wireless connection created on your Mac too. This would be helpful when you test your application outside without internet connection.

### Localhost Mode

![localHostMode](./Images/localHostModeFinal.png)

If you don't have iOS device, you can use your Xcode Simulator too. Using the url string like **http://localhost:4567** can work well with the server script.

## Setup and Run the Server

  You can get the server script from the **Server** folder from the current **Github Page**. Please follow the steps below to setup the server:
  
  1. Open your terminal app and go to the Server folder
  2. Run bash script with the command: `./run_log_server.bash`
  3. Open the webpage with the address shown in the command line

If everything goes well, you should see something similar to the following screenshots:

### Troubleshooting

##### **1.** Lack of command line developer tools

If you meet the following error, you may need to install the command line developer tools:

![xcodeSelectInstall](./Images/xcodeSelectInstall.jpg)
   
Run this command: `xcode-select -install`, then you will see the following dialog:
   
![xcodeSelect](./Images/xcodeSelect.png)
   
After installing it, try `./run_log_server.bash` command again. Problem should be solved.
   
##### **2.** Lack of Ruby install

If you meet the following error, you may need to install ruby:
   
![installRuby](./Images/installRuby.png)

Run this command: `sudo brew install ruby`, after installing ruby successfully, try `./run_log_server.bash` command again. Problem should be solved.
   
For other issues, please check the two problems above.
   
## Download and Import the SDK

You can download the iOS SDK from here: <http://developer.dji.com/en/mobile-sdk/downloads/>

If you are not familiar with importing the SDK to your Xcode project, please check this tutorial on Github: [Creating a Camera Application](https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK/iOS-FPVDemo)

## Enable Remote Logging

**1.** Implement the **DJISDKManagerDelegate** protocol method in the ViewController.m file's extension part. Then create a new method named **registerApp** and invoke it in the viewDidAppear method as shown below:

~~~objc
- (void)registerApp
{
    NSString *appKey = @"Enter Your App Key Here";
    [DJISDKManager registerApp:appKey withDelegate:self];
}

- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewDidAppear:animated];
    [self registerApp];    
}
~~~

> **Note:** If you don't know how to apply as a DJI developer and get the App Key, please refer to this [link](http://developer.dji.com/get-started/mobile-sdk/Register-Download).

**2**. Next, let's implement the DJISDKManagerDelegate method as shown below:

~~~objc
- (void)sdkManagerDidRegisterAppWithError:(NSError *)error
{
    NSString* message = @"Register App Successed!";
    if (error) {
        message = @"Register App Failed! Please enter your App Key and check the network.";
    }else
    {
        [DJISDKManager enableRemoteLoggingWithDeviceID:@"Enter Device ID Here" logServerURLString:@"Enter URL Here"];
    }
    
    [self showAlertViewWithTitle:@"Register App" withMessage:message];
}
~~~

The delegate method above gets called when the app is registered. If the registration is successful, we can call the `+(void) enableRemoteLoggingWithDeviceID: (NSString * _Nullable) deviceID logServerURLString: (NSString*) url;` class method of **DJISDKManager** to enable remote logging feature of the SDK by passing the **deviceID** parameter and **url** parameter, which you can get from the server script command line. 

> **Note:** 
> 
> **1.** The **deviceID** is used to distinguish different iOS devices. You can show log messages from different iOS devices on the same webpage.
> 
> **2.** The **url** is shown in the command line like this:
> 
> ![webUrl](./Images/webUrl.png)

**3**. Build and run the project in Xcode. If everything is OK, you will see a "Register App Successed!" alert once the application loads. 

## Show Log Message on Webpage

   Go to Main.storyboard and drag a UIButton to the center of the view, name it "Log SDK Version" and create an IBAction method, named `- (IBAction)logSDKVersionButtonAction:(id)sender` for it in the ViewController.m file. Implement the IBAction method shown as below:
   
~~~objc
- (IBAction)logSDKVersionButtonAction:(id)sender {
   DJILogDebug(@"SDK Version: %@", [DJISDKManager getSDKVersion]);
}
~~~

   In the code above, we use **DJILogDebug** Macro to show SDK's version info. There are five types of log Macros, you can use them for different purposes:
  
- DJILogError( )
- DJILogWarn( )
- DJILogInfo( )
- DJILogDebug( )
- DJILogVerbose( )

Finally, build and run the project, press the button, you may be able to see the SDK version log message on the webpage like the followings:
   
![appScreenshot](./Images/screenshot.png)
   
![webpageLog](./Images/webpageLog.png)

> **Note**: If you cannot see the logs on webpage and got the log message in the Xcode Console like this: 
> ![consoleLog](./Images/consoleLog.png)
> 
> You can solve this issue by adding the following item, "App Transport Security Settings" in the **Info.plist** file and modify the "Allow Arbitrary Loads" BOOL value to YES:
> 
> ![appTransport](./Images/appTransport.png)
> 

## Show Multiple iOS Devices Logs

  The DJI Remote Logger Tool supports multiple iOS devices logging, you can assign different Device IDs for different iOS devices in the `+(void) enableRemoteLoggingWithDeviceID: (NSString * _Nullable) deviceID logServerURLString: (NSString*) url;` class method of DJISDKManager.
  
  Also you can use url content filter for specific device's log like this: 
  `http://10.81.9.167:4567/?filter=113`.
